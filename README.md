# ERAnet – Emotion Recognition-based Assistive Learning Network

ERAnet is an assistive AI system designed to support children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) by improving emotional understanding, attention, and interaction. It combines computer vision, emoji-based learning cues, and real-time behavioral analysis to provide an adaptive learning experience.

---

## 🚀 Key Features
- **ASD Learning Phase:** Facial emotions are detected and visualized as emojis to simplify understanding.
- **Emotion Recognition Phase:** Child identifies the correct emoji for the detected emotion, with guided attempts.
- **Audio Analysis Phase:** Facial reactions while listening to audio are analyzed to compute an emotion score.
- **Real-time Interaction:** Designed to work in controlled sessions with therapists, parents, and ASD children.

---

## 📊 Model Performance
- Evaluated using **precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy**.
- Validated on benchmark datasets.
- Achieved **91.45% accuracy**, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.
