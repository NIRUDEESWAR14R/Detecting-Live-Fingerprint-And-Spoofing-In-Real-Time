# Detecting Live Fingerprint Spoofing in Real Time

A multimodal biometric authentication system designed to prevent spoofing attacks by combining fingerprint recognition with vein pattern analysis, DNA from perspiration, and physiological liveness detection.

---

## 🌐 Overview
Traditional fingerprint systems are vulnerable to spoofing using artificial fingerprints made from silicone, latex, or gelatin.  
This project introduces a **hybrid authentication system** that integrates biological and physiological signals to detect real users in real time.

---

## 🔐 Key Features
- **Fingerprint Recognition** — High-resolution ridge pattern detection.
- **Vein Pattern Mapping** — CMOS infrared sensor extracts sub-dermal vein structures.
- **Sweat-Based DNA Analysis** — Unique genomic identification.
- **Physiological Liveness Detection** — Pulse rate & SpO₂ measurement.
- **RF & Raman Technology** — Detects tissue conductivity and molecular signatures.
- **End-to-End Data Encryption** — AES / DES protection for biometric data.

## 🧠 Why Multimodal?
Single-modality biometrics can be spoofed.  
This system ensures:
- **Anti-spoofing reliability**
- **Lower false acceptance (FAR) / false rejection (FRR)**
- **High-security authentication for critical environments**
